Chrome Web Store Entry
======================

Description
-----------

Use the buttons added to your video controls or the [ and ] keyboard shortcuts to navigate backwards and forwards frame by frame.

Known issues:

- Sometimes the buttons will not load straight away. Reload your page and they will appear.

- Sometimes YouTube makes a change that stops this extension working. Let us know by raising an issue at https://github.com/CalumJEadie/frame-by-frame or even better, if you can, submit a pull request bringing it up to date.
